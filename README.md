# Web-Mapping
There were two programs which we used to complete this project. First one, created in
Python was a web crawler used to record the web links continuosly following one link to
another and recording them in a database, based on a given search term/phrase. The other
program also created in Python was then used to map the recorded data into a network graph and thus produce the
final output. The search engine used was ‘Bing’.
